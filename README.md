## Development notes

I built this app on Vue 2 and Bootstrap 4 as a personal project to hone and improve on my software development skills.

This app cannot be complete without third-party resources. I would like to give credits and many thanks to the following open-source contributors:

- **Spanish verb conjugation data**: [data source](). I added to their collection the subjunctive imperfect 2 conjugation using a custom algorithm.

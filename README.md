## :memo: Development notes

I built this app on Vue 2 and Bootstrap 4 as a personal project to hone and improve on my software development skills.

This app cannot be complete without third-party resources. I would like to give credits and many thanks to the following open-source contributors, whom I have never met in person or on the network:

- **Photography**: [Image](https://unsplash.com/photos/g_wXjMR2n8M) by [Rotiv Artic](https://unsplash.com/@rotivartic) on Unsplash

- **Spanish verb conjugation database**:
  - [Fred F. Jehle](https://users.pfw.edu/jehle/VERBLIST.HTM) created the original database
  - [ghidinelli](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs) compiled the database into a .csv file
  - My contributions:
    - Corrected misplaced 2nd-singular and 2nd-person plural imperative forms and other minor misplacements in the .csv file.
    - Added very few other Spanish verbs
    - Converted the updated collection into a .json file.

I created some custom algorithms that dynamically generate the subjunctive imperfect 2 conjugation and the 1st-person plural imperative form to the data collection. However, these additions are not stored in the .json file and are only accessible via this web app.
